        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Recommended Content </strong>
          <p>We suggest Content to users of the Site to showcase popular Content, promote Fan User engagement and encourage visitors to the Site to sign up as users. On the Site we recommend or display certain Artists Users’ Content or upcoming events which is visible to all users and in some cases, visitors of the Site.</p>
          <p>The way we determine which Artist Users’ Content will be showcased on the Home Page may be reflective of an Artist User’s popularity on the Site, the popularity of the Content on the Site, or may be Content which we have produced or are promoting in partnership with Artist Users.</p>
          <u>New</u>
          <p>Where Content is promoted as 'new' for example under the 'new' tab on the Site, the Content displayed is an automatic feed of newly uploaded Content. The way that 'new' Content is displayed is not based on any other criteria. We do this so that new Content is pushed to the forefront.</p>
          <u>Featured Content</u>
          <p>Content shown as 'featured' is determined by our committee of advisors. The Content chosen to be featured is entirely at the discretion of the committee however the committee will take into consideration several factors including:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>how popular the Content is on the Site e.g. the number of plays a song has. the more popular an Artist User’s Content is, the more likely it is that the Content will be featured;</li>
            <li>the Artist User's ‘score’, calculated automatically, which is reflective of each Artist User’s popularity on the Site, based on how much of their Content is viewed, listened to or purchased. The Artist User’s score is visible to all users of the Site on that Artist User’s profile page in the ‘about’ section;</li>
            <li>whether we have helped to produce that Content or have some involvement in it.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>We promote featured Content to enhance engagement with Fan Users and visitors to the Site, and to showcase our most popular Content.</p>
          <p>Featured Content displayed is updated from time to time.</p>
          <u>Genre</u>
          <p>‘Genre’ tabs are available so that users of the Site can filter Artist Users by genre by clicking on to a certain tab e.g. 'electronic' or 'drill'. Artist Users can label their Content as a particular genre through their own user accounts so that they can make use of this feature. We do this so that Fan Users can more easily view Content which they would prefer to view and so that Artist Users are more easily visible to Fan Users who may be interested in their Content. The newest Content in each genre tab will be shown first, automatically.</p>
          <u>'For You'</u>
          <p>Fan Users and Artist Users will have access to Content which is categorised as ‘For You’ which may be on a separate page or may show up when users of the Site go to search for Content. This Content will be recommended to specific users of the Site based on: </p>
          <ol>
            <li>the type of Content that user has previously engaged with, for example:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>whether the genre is similar to Content which that user tends to listen; or</li>
                <li>whether there is an overlapping fan base with Content that user tends to listen to.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>This is the strongest factor for whether Content will be recommended to users either on the 'For You' page or in the search facility. And;</li>
            <li>the type of Content we decide to feature (see above 'featured Content' for the factors taken into consideration).</li>
          </ol>
          <p>We do this to promote engagement on the Site, to promote Artist Users to other users who would likely enjoy their Content and to showcase our most popular Content. We believe that this keeps the Site more interest and engaging for Fan Users and creates a wider reach for Artist Users.</p>
          <p>To keep track of the type of Content our users engage with, we use cookies. For more information, see our <a href="/page/?id=cookies-policy">cookie policy</a> and <a href="/page/?id=privacy-policy">privacy policy</a> The data collected for that purpose is only through the Site.</p>

      <p>These terms tell you the rules for using our Site and apply to Artist Users only. Other terms which also apply to Artist Users are:</p>

      </ol>
      <p>You agree to the terms listed above (where they apply to you) by using the Site as an Artist.</p>
      <h2>1. Who can be an Artist User?</h2>
      <p>You can sign up to be an Artist User of the Site if you meet the criteria set out in in clauses (a) to (f)  below. By signing up to be an Artist User you warrant (i.e. make a legally enforceable promise) that you are:</p>
      <ol class="a">
        <li>an individual or legal person;</li>
        <li>at least 18 years old (or if the laws of the country/area in which you live require that you are at least another age in order to be legally bound by a contract with us, then you should be at least that age);</li>
        <li>permitted to use our Site by the laws of the country/ area in which you live;</li>
        <li>the owner of all Content you upload or have the right to upload it (as per the terms set out in clause 3 below).</li>
        <p>And will:</p>
        <li>Provide information or evidence to us if we request this, to prove that you meet the criteria to be an Artist User; and</li>
        <li>Provide accurate information in relation to your identity where we require information about your identity.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If an Artist User is a band/group, one individual would set up the account for the entire group. Please see clause 4 below for further information as to this.</p>
      <h2>2. How to become an Artist User</h2>
      <p>You can set up your account by clicking ‘Sign Up’ on the trax.so webpage.</p>
      <p>To become an Artist User, we require the following from you:</p>
      <ol class="a">
        <li>Your first name and surname;</li>
        <li>Your email address (which we will use to contact you if necessary)</li>
        <li>Your nationality;</li>
        <li>Your date of birth;</li>
        <li>A copy of one piece of government ID (e.g. a passport or driving licence);</li>
        <li>An avatar picture which will be visible to other users of the Site;</li>
        <li>A cover photograph which will be visible to other users of the Site;</li>
        <li>Your selected username;</li>
        <li>A picture of your face so that we can check this against your government ID.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>You will be asked in what capacity you are creating an Artist account, i.e. whether you are:</p>
      <ol class="a">
        <li>An individual;</li>
        <li>Signing up a band/group (in which case clause 4 applies to you); or</li>
        <li>An Agent and/or Manager signing up an Artist on behalf of them (for example your client). In this case Terms for Agents will apply to you: <a href="/page/?id=terms-of-use-for-agents">Terms of Use for Agents</a></li>
      </ol>
      <p>You will also be asked if you are signing up on behalf of a group/band.</p>
      <p>Once we have the information requested, we will go through a vetting process. If we come across anything we consider to be an issue, we may request further information from you or decline your application to become an Artist User.</p>
      <p>Once you are set up as an Artist, you will have an ‘Artist page’. This page shows your posts, music, merch, events and ‘about’ section. You will be given access to your artist portal which sets out what you can do through the Site and how you can post Content. You will also be asked to let us know what kind of music you create, for example ‘electronic’, which will be displayed on the Artist page.</p>
      <p>Please note our <a href="/page/?id=privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> applies in respect of the personal data you provide to us. You may wish to review this policy and the other terms that apply to you before setting up your Artist User account.</p>
      <h2>3. Artists’ Content</h2>
      <p>Artist Users of the Site are directed to their own portal which sets out what they are able to do through the Site. This may include adding Content to their page and creating a biography. Such Content may be visible on the Feed or Explore Page. Artists’ content will generally be visible to all other users of the Site (and in some cases, visitors to the Site who have not signed up to be users).</p>
      <p>The Content which Fans purchase is made available to them through the Site.</p>
      <p>You as an Artist are personally responsible for your Content you post and share. You are also responsible for ensuring that you comply with the Site’s terms.</p>
      <p>The Content that Artists post and is made available to Fans <u>must</u> meet the following criteria. By using the Site as an Artist, you warrant (i.e. make a legally enforceable promise) that:</p>
      <ol class="a">
        <li>Any Content that you post or provide belongs to you (or another member of your band/group), or you are legally allowed to post such content on our Site (including having any licenses, consents or releases that are necessary);</li>
        <li>By posting any Content on the Site, or providing any Content to other users of the Site, you do not violate any applicable law, intellectual property rights or other rights of any third party;</li>
        <li>By posting (whether on the Site or elsewhere) or providing Content to other users of the Site, you do not claim any affiliation with us (unless you do actually have an affiliation with us as may be confirmed by us in writing);</li>
        <li>Any Content you post or provide does not violate any of our terms, particularly our <a href="/page/?id=acceptable-use-policy">Acceptable Use Policy</a> or our <a href="/page/?id=terms-of-service/">Terms and Conditions for All Users</a>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>You agree that we are not responsible for and we do not support the Content that you as an Artist User post on the Site or provide to other users of the Site (other than what is set out in our terms).</p>
      <p>We do not check all Content which Artists post to the Site however may do so on occasion or if we have reason to believe that an Artist is posting content which may violate our terms. We are not obliged to check all Artist Content.</p>
      <p>If you breach the terms in this clause 3, and any damage or loss is caused due to your breach, we shall not be held responsible for that damage or loss deriving from the said breach.</p>
      <p>You agree to indemnify us (i.e. compensate us for any loss caused) if any of these promises/warranties are not true.</p>
      <p>If a user of the Site makes a complaint to us about any Content which you post or provide, we reserve the right to demand further information from you about that content, for example to be sent evidence of the Content itself.</p>
      <h2>4. Bands/Groups</h2>
      <p>When you sign up as an Artist User on behalf of your band/group, you warrant (i.e. make a legally enforceable promise) that you have permission from the other members of your band/group to sign them up as per the terms of the Site.</p>
      <p>Essentially, you are entering the other band/group members into the contract with us.</p>
      <p>When you sign up as an Artist User on behalf of a band/group, we will assume that consent has been given to you from each relevant individual.</p>
      <p>We will also assume that whoever is uploading the Content has the intellectual property rights in it i.e. that the band/group has the rights in it.</p>
      <p>In relation to revenue, it is not our responsibility to ensure that any revenue Artists make through the Site is split evenly between members of a band/group. It is the responsibility of whoever posts Content on behalf of the Artist to divide up the revenue (or not – this is up to you as a band/group).</p>
      <h2>5. Co-authored Content</h2>
      <p>If you as an Artist User upload Content which includes anyone other than you (including members of a band/group), you warrant (i.e. make a legally enforceable promise to us) that the other person/people either:</p>
      <ol class="a">
        <li>Consent to being part of that Content, are 18 years of age or older, and are not prevented from consenting to this e.g. because of any capacity or jurisdiction issues; or</li>
        <li>Is/are an Artist User of the Site.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>We reserve the right to request evidence if we suspect that the above may not apply.</p>
      <p>If 5(b) applies, Artist Users should make efforts to credit the co-authoring Artist User, for example by noting this along with the Content and noting their username.</p>
      <p>If the Content that is co-authored has been created by more than one Artist of the Site (i.e. is a work of ‘joint authorship’), you are responsible for obtaining any licences or similar necessary to allow such Content to be posted on the Site. It is not our responsibility to check or monitor this.</p>
      <p>It is not our responsibility to ensure that revenue derived from co-authored Content or joint authorship is split evenly or enforce any agreements between Artists. We are not responsible for monitoring this or making decisions as to any split of revenue. We suggest that Artists consider this before working together through the Site and any agreement between Artists shall be a private agreement which does not include us as a party.</p>
      <p>However, it is possible for multiple Artist Users to split revenue within the Site if:</p>
      <ol class="a">
        <li>Each individual/band is an Artist User; and</li>
        <li>Each of those Artist Users accepts cryptocurrency payments.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>You agree that any claims which may arise because of co-Authored Content on the Site will be made against the/an Artist which was actually involved in the making Content or who appeared in it or posted it. You agree that we are not liable for any such claims.</p>
      <h2>6. Credits</h2>
      <p>The Arist User is responsible for crediting the Content on behalf of their Band/Group, Co-Authors or even themselves, not us.</p>
      <h2>7. Agents and/or Managers</h2>
      <p>If you as an Artist use an Agent and/or Manager to run your account for you, for example who signs up for you or posts Content for you, it is your responsibility to ensure that the Agent and/or Manager is doing so in a way that you are happy with.  For example, it is up to you whether you are sharing your log in details with your Agent and/or Manager and it is your responsibility to keep those details safe.</p>
      <p>When signing up, Agents and/or Managers have to confirm the capacity in which they are creating an Artist account i.e. that they are the Agent and/or Manager and not the Artist User.</p>
      <p>In relation to revenue or Agent and/or Manager commission, this is not our responsibility and we are not involved in this. Again, we have no part in your relationship or contract with an Agent and/or Manager.</p>
      <p>You agree that any claims which may arise because of actions that your Agent and/or Manager took on your behalf through our Site, will be made against the Agent and/or Manager himself and not us.</p>
      <h2>8. Our right to suspend or terminate your account</h2>
      <p>If you as an Artist User behave in a way that is illegal or immoral, particularly if these actions would cause us any harm to our brand, we reserve the right to suspend your account for any amount of time or terminate it.</p>
      <p>This is in addition to our other terms which set out our right to suspend or terminate your account.</p>
      <p>If you breach any of our terms or the Standard Contract between Fan and Creator, we retain the right to suspend or terminate your account.</p>
      <h2>9. Artist content/information on our Site which we post or create</h2>
      <p>Our Home Page displays certain Artists Users’ work, for example under the headings ‘Hot Tracks’, ‘New Releases’ and ‘New Music’ which may include upcoming events and new Content. We do this to showcase certain Content and promote engagement.</p>
      <p>For more information on how we select which Content is visible on the Home Page, please see our <a href="/page/?id=terms-of-service/">Terms and Conditions for All Users</a> under the heading ‘Recommended Content’.</p>
      <h2>10. Advertising and linking</h2>
      <p>Artist Users are permitted to advertise using their Site pages or Content, where it complies with the Site’s terms.</p>
      <p>Artist Users are permitted to post links to other websites where it complies with the <a href="/page/?id=terms-of-service/">Terms and Conditions for All Users</a>. In some cases, this may be through your Artist User biography on your Site page, and in others, we may make provision for integrated buttons so that you can link out to other websites or apps.</p>
      <h2>11. Payments to you</h2>
      <p>The terms in this clause are supplemental to what is set out in the a href="/page/?id=standard-contract-between-fan-and-creator">Standard Contract between Fans and Artists</a>. As payment facilitator, we set out here how payments via Transactions would be made available to you.</p>
      <p>Fan payments to you will be sent by a third-party provider, for example STRIPE. We do not handle funds directly.</p>
      <p>Where you choose to accept payment via STRIPE or a similar third-party provider, our commission will be taken automatically upon transfer.</p>
      <p>You should ensure that you have sufficient funds to refund Fan Users as per the a href="/page/?id=standard-contract-between-fan-and-creator">Standard Contract between Fans and Artists</a>. In some circumstances, Fan Users may be entitled to refunds of their payment and it is not our responsibility to provide this refund, nor to refund the commission amount.</p>
      <p>Where payments are made in respect of Subscriptions, the payment to you may be made monthly.</p>
      <p>Once a Transaction is processed, you will be notified through the Site or by email or both. We will facilitate a receipt to the Fan User once a Transaction has been completed.</p>
      <p>If you find that you have not been paid but should have been, please contact us at: <i>support@trax.so</i>.</p>
      <p>Payments due to you but not yet paid may be withheld or delayed if:</p>
      <ol class="a">
        <li>You have breached any part of our terms;</li>
        <li>We have suspicion or know that the purchaser has made the purchase in a fraudulent manner and we need to investigate this.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>We reserve the right to withhold payment due to you but not yet paid for the above reasons until we have finalised our investigation and will aim to do so within one (1) month from the date that we uncovered a reason for us to investigate. However, this may take longer depending on the circumstances. We will endeavour to update you in respect of this. Depending on the conclusion of our investigation, it is possible that funds may need to be sent back to the Fan User.</p>
      <p>Depending on what you select when you sign up as an Artist User, your Artist page will let Fans and visitors to the Site know if you accept cryptocurrency payments.</p>
      <p>We keep track of Artist User earnings on an annual basis.</p>
      <h2>12. Our commission</h2>
      <p>We take 10% commission for every Transaction made on the Site. In connection with smart contracts/ ICP Transactions, our commission is automatically taken on transfer.</p>
      <h2>13. VAT/Tax</h2>
      <p>Artists should seek relevant professional advice on any tax-related matters if necessary. We cannot advise on this nor are we (or any of our related parties or advisors) responsible for your tax affairs.</p>
      <p>By using the Site as an Artist, you promise to abide by the tax laws and regulations of your jurisdiction e.g. reporting payments made to you through the Site, to the relevant tax authority. You agree that it is your responsibility and obligation to do so.</p>
      <p>You must pay any VAT amount paid to you, directly to HMRC as applicable.</p>
      <p>If you are subject to any investigation, litigation or other dispute relating to tax which involves payments through our Site, you will notify us by email at support@trax.so letting us know the following information:</p>
      <ol class="a">
        <li>What the alleged non-compliance is;</li>
        <li>What the current situation is i.e. are you currently in proceedings or have you just received a notice that you are being investigated.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>We may request further information if reasonable to do so, which you will provide to us promptly.</p>
      <p>We may close your account with us if you are found to be tax non-compliant.</p>
      <p>We do not keep track of Artists’ payments of tax/VAT.</p>
      <h2>14. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>Where you post or provide content which belongs to you as an Artist, you retain all intellectual property in that content even though it is posted or provided to another user by way of the Site.</p>
      <p>However, so that we can ensure that the content you post is available on the Site and visible to other users and visitors of the Site, you agree to grant us a licence to that content (the ‘License’). This means that:</p>
      <ol class="a">
        <li>you agree to allow us to reproduce, distribute, make available, perform, display, translate, creative derivative works from, and create adaptations and derivative works from, that content;</li>
        <li>you agree that we can do anything in (a) above by any method and using any technology;</li>
        <li>you agree that the License you grant us is non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, fully paid, irrevocable, royalty-free and worldwide; and</li>
        <li>you agree to waive any moral rights (or similar applicable law in your jurisdiction) and agree not to enforce these.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>None of the terms set out here in relation to the License are intended to have any impact on your ownership of any intellectual property rights. Further, these terms only apply to the extent that they are permitted under law.</p>
      <p>If you believe that another user of the Site has breached your intellectual property rights, please contact us, providing as much information as possible, at the following email address: <i>support@trax.so</i>.</p>
      <p>Please also see our <a href="/page/?id=complaints-policy">Complaints Policy</a> for further details on how to make a complaint to us.</p>
      <h2>15. Assignment of your username</h2>
      <p>We understand that you may wish to assign your username/account to someone else (the ‘assignee’) in future.</p>
      <p>If you do so, you must ensure that all necessary intellectual property and other rights are also transferred to the assignee. You also warrant (i.e. make a legally enforceable promise) that the assignee is capable of being an Artist User and can enter into the contract with us and with Fans as per the terms of the Site.</p>
      <p>You agree to indemnify us (i.e. compensate us for any loss caused) for any loss or damage caused because you did not follow the terms set out in this clause, including if you did not actually transfer the intellectual property rights in the Content and your account generally to the transferee when assigning your account/username.</p>
      <p>The valid assignment of the username/account is conditional our written consent. We are not responsible for such an assignment however may take any action we consider necessary if we suspect that the transfer has been made not in accordance with this clause. For example, we may suspend or terminate the account if assignment has been made to a transferee who is not able to agree to the relevant terms of the Site.</p>
      <p>You will inform us of any proposed assignment in a reasonable time prior to the actual assignment. You will do this by contacting us at support@trax.so noting who the assignee is, when the transfer will happen and the contact details for the assignee.</p>
      <h2>16. Royalties</h2>
      <p>It is the Artist’s responsibility to manage Royalties. You agree that we are not responsible for payment to any third parties in relation to your account or your Content.</p>
      <h2>17. Platform to Business Regulations</h2>
      <p>The Platform to Business Regulations (Regulation (EU) 2019/1150) (the ‘Regulations’) apply to any provider of an online intermediation service to business users established or resident in the EU. The UK has retained much of these rules (see Online Intermediation Services for Business Users (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020)  which means that the rules also apply to business users who are established or are resident in the UK.</p>
      <p>Artist Users of the Site are considered ‘business users’ under the Regulations because they are private individuals offering goods or services to customers relating to their trade. We are an online intermediation under the Regulations service because we allow Artists to offer goods and services to customers whilst initiating transactions between them.</p>
      <p>By using the Site, Artists agree that they will conform with the rules set out under the Regulations as far as the rules apply to them.</p>
      <p>The Regulations form part of our agreement with you if they apply to you. The Regulations set out our obligations, including in respect of transparency and fairness.</p>
      <p>If you consider that we have not complied with our obligations under the Regulations, please contact us at the following email address with details of your complaint: support@trax.so.</p>
      <h2>18. Our responsibility for loss or damage suffered by you</h2>
      <p>We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so. This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors and for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>
      <p>If defective digital content that we have supplied, damages a device or digital content belonging to you and this is caused by our failure to use reasonable care and skill, we will either repair the damage or pay you compensation.

    title: 'Referral Scheme Policy',
    content: `
      <p><b>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SITE AND OUR REFERRAL SCHEME</b></p>
      <p>Please click <a href="/page/?id=platform-to-business-regulation-terms/">here</a> to see a full list of definitions which apply to all of our terms.</p>
      <h2>1. When do these terms apply?</h2>
      <p>This Referral Scheme Policy only applies where current Artist Users sign up to use our Referral Scheme.</p>
      <p>Please note that we do not claim that users of our Site will be able to make huge profits, or any profits at all, from participating in the Referral Scheme.</p>
      <h2>2. What is the Referral Scheme?</h2>
      <p>Our Referral Scheme allows for current Artist Users of the Site to introduce new Artist Users to the Site, and the chance to benefit from doing so. Please note that if the Referring Artist’s account is suspended or terminated, that user will not be permitted to participate in the Referral Scheme.</p>
      <h2>3. How to use the Referral Scheme?</h2>
      <p>On an Artist User’s page, you will be able to access a unique referral link and referral code and share this with other individuals.  The Referred Artist must then click that unique referral link or use the referral code which will take them to the Site’s sign-up page for Artist Users. If a Referred Artist signs up in a way which is not through using your unique referral link or code, then they are not eligible to receive any Benefit Payments and have not referred that new user in accordance with this policy.</p>
      <h2>4. The Benefit Payment to you</h2>
      <p>Payment will be made to a Referring Artist when the Referred Artist which they introduced in accordance with this policy has profited from a Transaction through the Site.</p>
      <p>The way the Benefit Payment is calculated is:</p>
      <ol class="a">
        <li>For 12 months following the date that the Referred Artist signed up as an Artist User on our Site, the Referring Artist will make 5% on each of the Referred Artist’s Transactions;</li>
        <li>Following the first 12 months at (a) above, the Referring Artist will make 1% on each of the Referred Artist’s Transactions.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Any Benefit Payment due to a Referring Artist will be credited to their user account automatically and the Referring Artist will then be able to withdraw this in the usual timeframe.</p>
      <p>Please note that the Benefit Payment in accordance with this policy is a proportion of our commission and is not borne by the Referred Artist e.g. we would take 5% commission and the other 5% which would have been our commission, is now the Benefit Payment.</p>
      <p>We reserve the right to make changes to the way the Benefit Payment is calculated and the way the Referral Scheme works. We will notify you of these changes in accordance with our terms.</p>
      <h2>5. Other Terms</h2>
      <p>Please note:</p>
      <ol class="a">
        <li>If you refer a Referred User in accordance with this policy, and that Referred User creates more than one account, you can only make Benefit Payments from the Referred User’s first account with the Site;</li>
        <li>Benefit payments are inclusive of any VAT which is chargeable or becomes chargeable;</li>
        <li>A Referred User cannot have previously had an account with us, whether that be an Artist User account or a Fan User account.</li>
        <li>If we discover that a Referred User is managed in any way by the Referring User, this is not in accordance with this policy, and no Benefit Payments will be facilitated.</li>
        <li>You are not permitted to assign, pledge or similar Benefit Payments. We retain the right to withhold or withdraw Benefit Payments if we become aware of this sort of activity.</li>
        <li>You are not permitted to entice anyone into making payments or Transactions so that you or they can benefit from the Referral Scheme.</li>
        <li>Benefit Payments may be withheld by us if:

    title: 'Standard Contract between Artists and Fans',
    content: `
      <p><b>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SITE AS A FAN USER OR ARTIST USER</b></p>
      <p>Please click <a href="/page/?id=platform-to-business-regulation-terms/">here</a> to see a full list of definitions which apply to all of our terms.</p>
      <h2>1. What’s in this Standard Contract between Artist and Fans (the ‘Standard Contract’)?</h2>
      <p>The terms of this Standard Contract apply to Fan Users and Artist Users in relation to Transactions on the Site (alongside the other terms which apply to each user).</p>
      <p>This Standard Contract is legally binding on the Fan and Artist user when they enter into a Transaction.</p>
      <h2>2. Who are the parties to this Standard Contract?</h2>
      <p>As above, the parties will be Fan Users and Artist Users who enter into a Transaction via the Site.</p>
      <p>We are not a party to this Standard Contract and neither are any of our subsidiaries, agents or otherwise unless stated to be.</p>
      <p>We only act as a payment facilitator and are not directly involved in Transactions, except where our role is set out in this Standard Contract or elsewhere in our terms.</p>
      <h2>3. How do payments work in Transactions?</h2>
      <p>When a Fan User enters into a Transaction with an Artist User, the Fan User agrees to make the relevant payment to the Artist User. The amount of the payment will be set by the Artist User and made visible to other users.</p>
      <p>The amount applicable to the Transaction may or may not include VAT or other Tax. This also applies to any tips made to Artist Users and payment in respect of Subscriptions.</p>
      <p>Payments will be made to Artist Users directly by way of a smart contract for crypto payments, and our commission will be taken automatically.</p>
      <p>Tips can also be made by Fan Users to Artist Users as gratuity payments, however this will be limited. A Fan User will be able to choose the amount of tip they would like to give, if any, by selecting the tip option of an Artist User’s profile and typing a number (eg. £2.50, £15).</p>
      <p>A Fan User is only able to tip any one Artist User up to £1,000 in a seven day period and £8,000 in a twelve month period.</p>
      <p>Tips will be in the amount which the Fan User selects. A Fan User can decide the amount of the tip they wish to give by selecting one of the options set out by us.</p>
      <h2>4. Subscriptions</h2>
      <p>Artist Users can make their Content Subscription-only. Content will be labelled as such so that it is clear which Content is available to Fan Users by Subscription only.</p>
      <p>In relation to the Content available by Subscription only, Fan Users upon subscribing can choose a Subscription Period (either one calendar month or one year), which then will automatically renew on a monthly basis in perpetuity until it is cancelled in accordance with these terms.</p>
      <p>If a Fan User wishes to cancel a Subscription, they will have the option to do this by way of their account. Once the Subscription is cancelled, the Subscription continues until the end of the relevant Subscription Period and then ends. For example, if a Subscription is rolling monthly and a Fan User cancels it, the Subscription continues until the end of that month and then does not continue to the next month.</p>
      <h2>5. What is Trax’s role?</h2>
      <p>As above, we are the payment facilitator.</p>
      <p>By entering into a Transaction, both Fan Users and Artist Users authorise us (and any of our subsidiaries or third parties we may contract with) to act as payment facilitator. This includes processing payments, holding and collecting funds, deducting any applicable VAT or other Tax, collecting our commission, and if applicable, paying out funds due to Artists Users and Referring Users.</p>
      <h2>6. How does the Fan User access the Content once the Transaction is complete?</h2>
      <p>Once the Fan Payment is made, the Content is usually made available to the Fan User by way of the Site itself.</p>
      <p>In providing the Content to the Fan User to view, the Artist User gives the Fan User a limited licence to that Content, which the Fan User cannot transfer or sub-licence. This limited licence is also not exclusive. The purpose of this licence is so that the Fan User can view or listen the Content which they have paid to view or listen to.</p>
      <p>However, the granting of this licence does not mean that any ownership or rights in the Content is transferred to the Fan User.  The rights in that Content are retained by the Artist User to which they belong.</p>
      <p>The limited licence provided by the Artist User to the Fan User on completion of a Transaction in relation to the Content expires without notice to the Fan User if:</p>
      <ol class="a">
        <li>The payment for the Content bounces back or is reversed and therefore payment has not been made;</li>
        <li>The Content purchased was live or only available for a short time and has now ended;</li>
        <li>A Subscription which a Fan User has paid for ends (only applicable to Transactions in respect of Subscriptions);</li>
        <li>The Fan User’s account with us is suspended, terminated or closed;</li>
        <li>The Content is no longer available for whatever reason, for example is removed from the Artist User’s page;</li>
        <li>The purchaser in the Transaction is no longer entitled to view the Content purchased for whatever reason, including that the user’s account has been suspended or terminated or we suspect that the user has breached our terms and we are investigating this.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>7. Are there any limitations on what the Fan User can do with the Content?</h2>
      <p>Once a Fan User is granted the limited licence as above, they are able to access the relevant Content through the Site.</p>
      <p>The Fan User must act in accordance with our <a href="/page/?id=acceptable-use-policy">Acceptable Use Policy</a> in respect of how they access and use the Content, and in accordance with the terms of our Site in general.</p>
      <h2>8. Can Fan Users cancel a Transaction or obtain a refund?</h2>
      <p>If following the completion of the Transaction, any Content relating to that Transaction is available to view before the end of the period of 14 days from the date of entry into the Transaction or the Fan User has paid using cryptocurrency, the Fan User has no right to cancel the Transaction. By entering into this Standard Contract, the Fan User gives their express consent to this loss of right to cancel.</p>
      <p>This contract does not however affect any right under statute which a Fan User may have to receive a refund.</p>
      <p>If a Fan User is entitled to a refund under statute, it is the responsibility of the Artist User to provide such refund and the Site has no responsibility to provide any refunds.</p>
      <h2>9. Terms agreed between Artist and Fan in respect of each Transaction:</h2>
      <ol class="a">
        <li>A Fan User entering into a Transaction agrees to make the payment required before the Content being purchased can be viewed;</li>
        <li>Fan Users and Artist Users must abide by all the terms of the Site which apply to them (see <a href="/page/?id=terms-of-service/">Terms and Conditions for All Users</a> for a complete list) when entering into Transactions and when accessing and viewing Content purchased;</li>
        <li>Artist Users will make Content available to the Fan User once that Fan User has purchased that Content, which may or may not be immediate depending on the type of Content;</li>
        <li>Artist Users and Fan Users agree that we are not responsible for Content being provided to the Fan User when purchased. It is the sole responsibility of the Artist User to provide the Content to the Fan User who has purchased it;</li>
        <li>Artists Users are under no obligation to continue to create Content;</li>
        <li>Fan Users viewing, accessing, and downloading Content purchased by way of a Transaction through the Site do so at their own risk. We are not responsible for any issues with that Content. The Artist User is also not responsible (unless they have been negligent or breached any duty owed to the Fan User).</li>
        <li>Artist Users who sell Content via Transactions to Fan Users warrant (i.e. make a legally enforceable promise) that they own that Content and/or have all necessary rights in it in order to licence it to the Fan User as per this contract.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>10. Must Artist Users continue to provide Content to Fan Users?</h2>
      <p>Once the Content purchased is provided to the Fan User by way of the Transaction, that Artist User is under no obligation to continue to create Content.</p>
      <p>Artist Users generally are not under an obligation to continue to create Content on the Site, including where Fan Users have entered into a Subscription (unless it has been agreed otherwise between the Fan User and Artist User).</p>
      <p>Artist Users may add and remove Content from their page as and when they choose to, for whatever reason (unless this is contrary to any of the terms of our Site).</p>
      <h2>11. What if a Fan User is unable to view Content purchased?</h2>
      <p>Fan Users agree that they understand there may be situations whereby they are unable to view Content, for example:</p>
      <ol class="a">
        <li>If there is an ongoing technical issue; or</li>
        <li>If either the Fan User’s or Artist User’s account is suspended or terminated.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>We have no role in providing Content to Fan Users (as is set out in this Standard Contract, in respect of Transactions we are only a payment intermediary). However, if there is an issue which Fan Users would like to report to us, for example if they consider that an Artist User is in breach of the terms of our <a href="/page/?id=acceptable-use-policy">Acceptable Use Policy</a> in respect of the Content, they may contact us by email: <i>support@trax.so</i>.</p>
      <h2>12. What if a dispute arises in respect of this Standard Contract?</h2>
      <p>This Standard Contract is governed by English Law and therefore English Law will apply to any claim arising out of or in relation to this Standard Contract.</p>
      <p>Claims arising out of or in relation to this Standard Agreement may be brought in the courts of England and Wales or the courts of the county where the Fan User lives. This is unless the Fan User and Artist User agree otherwise.</p>

      <h2>5. Disclosures of your personal data</h2>
      <p>We may share your personal data where necessary with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table <b>Purposes for which we will use your personal data above</b>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Specific third parties such as:
          <ol>
            <li>Beehiiv, including for the purpose of sending out newsletters;</li>
            <li>Typeform, including for the purpose of signing up for events;</li>
            <li>MailChimp, including for the purpose of sending out mass campaigns;</li>
            <li>Omnisend, for the purpose of email marketing;</li>
            <li>Onfido, for the purpose of identity checks; and</li>
            <li>Stripe, for the purpose of facilitating Transactions.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
      <h2>6. International transfers</h2>
      <p>We may share your personal data with third parties (as set out in clause 5). Where this involves the transfer of your personal data outside of the UK, we will ensure that either:</p>
      <ol class="a">
        <li>The transfers are to countries that fall under the ‘adequacy provisions’ under the GDPR; or</li>
        <li>We put in place any of the appropriate safeguards as set out in the GDPR; or</li>
        <li>Where there is no appropriate safeguard in place, we are authorised by law to facilitate the transfer.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>7. Data security</h2>
      <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
      <h2>8. Data retention</h2>
      <p><b>How long will you use my personal data for?</b></p>
      <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.</p>
      <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.</p>
      <p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see paragraph 9 below for further information.</p>
      <p>In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
      <h2>9. Your legal rights</h2>
      <p>You have a number of rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.</p>
      <p>You have the right to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
        <li>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
        <li>Request erasure of your personal data in certain circumstances. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
        <li>Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) as the legal basis for that particular use of your data (including carrying out profiling based on our legitimate interests). In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your right to object.</li>
        <li>You also have the absolute right to object any time to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes (see OPTING OUT OF MARKETING in paragraph 4 for details of how to object to receiving direct marketing communications).</li>
        <li>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
        <li>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data (see the table in section 4 for details of when we rely on your consent as the legal basis for using your data). However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
        <li>Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in one of the following scenarios:
          <ul>
            <li>If you want us to establish the data's accuracy;</li>
            <li>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;</li>
            <li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or</li>
            <li>You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at <i>support@trax.so</i>.</p>
      <p><b>No fee usually required</b></p>
      <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
      <p><b>What we may need from you</b></p>
      <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
      <p><b>Time limit to respond</b></p>
      <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
      <h2>10. Contact details</h2>
      <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy or about the use of your personal data or you want to exercise your privacy rights, please contact our DPO in the following ways:</p>

      </ul>
      <h2>11. Complaints</h2>
      <p>You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK regulator for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance.</p>
      <h2>12. Changes to the privacy policy and your duty to inform us of changes</h2>
      <p>We keep our privacy policy under regular review. This version was last updated on 9 August 2024. Historic versions can be obtained by contacting us.</p>

      <p>This website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you.
